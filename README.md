## Installation

    yarn add react-swm-icon-pack

or

    npm i react-swm-icon-pack

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Air } from 'react-swm-icon-pack';

const App = () => {
  return <Air />;
};

export default App;
```

You can also pass inline props to the icon

```jsx
<Air color="purple" set="duotone" size="40" />
```

or even your custom styles

```jsx
<Air style={{ transform: 'scale(2, 0.5)' }} />
```

You can also use SWMIcon component and pass as a prop icon name you prefer:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { SWMIcon } from 'react-swm-icon-pack';

const App = () => {
  return <SWMIcon name="Air" color="purple" set="duotone" />;
};

export default App;
```

You can also include the whole icon pack:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import * as SWMIconPack from 'react-swm-icon-pack';

const App = () => {
  return <SWMIconPack.Air color="purple" set="duotone" size="40" />;
};

export default App;
```

You can also use `SWMIconProvider` component, this will make all the icons that are within the context use the Provider properties.
Setting props for any icon wrapped in SWMIconProvider will override Provider's properties.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { SWMIconProvider, Air, Calendar, Cam } from 'react-swm-icon-pack';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SWMIconProvider color="purple" set="duotone" size="40" strokeWidth="1.8">
      <Air />
      <Calendar />
      <Cam color="blue" set="curved" />
    </SWMIconProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```
